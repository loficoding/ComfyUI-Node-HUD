# ComfyUI Node HUD 🛠️

**Stop the spaghetti. Keep the data.**

A lightweight UI extension for [ComfyUI](https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI) that adds a smart "Heads-Up Display" (HUD) to your nodes. It allows you to stack nodes behind one another to clean up your workspace, while still seeing exactly what is happening inside the stack via a sleek, tinted-glass dock.

## ✨ Features

### 1. Hiding Nodes 
Hide utility nodes (like String Primitives, Notes, or multiple LoRAs) behind a single "Parent" node. Clean Layout Dock detects these hidden nodes and generates a live status bar attached to the bottom of the parent.

### 2. Smart I/O Indicators 🚦
No more guessing if a hidden node is connected. The dock displays **Smart Dots** that visualize the data flow:
* **Left Dots (Inputs):** Shows active incoming connections.
* **Right Dots (Outputs):** Shows active outgoing data.
* **Color Coded:** The dots match ComfyUI's standard wire colors:
    * 🟣 **Purple:** Model
    * 🟡 **Yellow:** CLIP
    * 🔴 **Red:** VAE
    * 🌸 **Pink:** Latent
    * 🔵 **Blue:** Image
    * 🟢 **Green:** String / Text

### 3. Live Status Feedback
The dock updates in real-time to reflect the state of your nodes:
* **Active:** Green text / Standard border.
* **Muted:** Gray border & dimmed text.
* **Bypassed:** Purple border.
* **Disconnected:** If a node has no active inputs or outputs, a red error dot 🔴 appears.

### 4. "Tinted Glass" UI
The dock uses a semi-transparent dark background (85% opacity) to ensure readability without feeling "heavy" or blocking the grid entirely.
